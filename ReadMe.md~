# Background

## Task 1

The first dataset, `timing_observations.csv` contains scheduled and observed stop arrivals and departures for Route 56. Task T1Q1 asks to calculate and plot the daily OTP during March 2022.

To complete this task, a number of data cleaning operations are performed, although I suspect are redundant:
1) Remove all dates outside of March 2022
2) Remove all stops that should be be considered, and check to make sure that the dataframe is just left with the relevant stops

I also converted all the timing data to seconds, taking a full day to contain 86400 seconds.

For each day (there are 31 in total) I work out the OTP for trip_id. This is because Route 56 happens many times a day, and so the OTP is worked out for each trp_id. Note that as the trip_id is a long string, each unique trip_id is converted to a number, where the first trip of the day is identifed by 0, and increments by 1 for each new trip_id. As such, there is a plot for each day, with each plot containing the OTP for each trip_id that occured that day.


Task T1Q2 asks to only use data for weekdays, calculate and plot the hourly OTP for Route 56, using scheduled_start_time to bin the data. This question was a little ambigious, as one could create plots for each date, presenting the OTP in terms of binned scheduled_start_date just for that day. What I choose to do, was actually to look more at the averages. So after removing the weekends from the data, I am left with five week days. Taking, for example, Monday, I took all the data associated with all the Mondays, and calculated the OTP for each hour that there was a bus scheduled to operate. As such, an hour will represent several Mondays. Hence, we can see how often a bus was on time between the hours of say 5am-6am every Monday. This will be represented by the x-axis label '5'.
